Milestone 1: Enable full contact upload from CSV and social media (Google+ OR Twitter, LinkedIn) – ensure this works
- User clicks on google+
- Login / pw for google+ pops up
- After entering credentials, Obvien requests user to integrate social networks
- LinkedIn addition walks user through process of exporting CSV
- User uploads LinkedIn CSV
- LinkedIn network added into Obvien database
- Obvien matches LinkedIn contacts with contacts pulled through Google+
- Obvien now has FIRST NAME, LAST NAME and COMPANY

Milestone 2: Add API (e.g., crunchbase) and enhance company information
- Companies identified through exported LinkedIn CSV and integrated into Obvien database is matched with external API
- Enhanced company information from API populates with ALL contacts associated with the specific company (e.g., AT&T, HQ, # Employees, Revenue, etc.) for ALL contacts who have ever worked at AT&T -- both private and public information
- Research will be needed to confirm which API is best suited for this beta



Milestone 3: Build scraper for Wikipedia that can pull in specific information (API should match with teams)
E.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady

SEARCH CAPABILITY

Milestone 4: Confirm keyword-based search pulls in all information that was generated from enhanced information from API and Wikipedia and SEC.gov (currently integrated into Obvien – must confirm this on back-end)

Milestone 5: Add weighted searches for minimum 2 areas (e.g., below)
a. Company size (employees) – weighted criteria – more important / less important, with identifying less / more number of employees
b. Company size (revenue) – weighted criteria – more important / less important, with identifying less / more revenue
c. Industry (mapped to related industries (pull map from NAICS code based on related)… DEPEND ON API

Milestone 6: Share network to increase network search for user

Milestone 7: Enable capability to invite others to Obvien platform as part of registration

Milestone 8: Enable full beta registration process with notifications
- User registers: “Welcome to Obvien! Let’s get you started shows walk-through”
